= Sprint 4: Bills & Reminders

== Sprint Plan
> **Goal:** Model recurring bills and surface upcoming due-date reminders.

.User Stories
****
[horizontal,labelwidth=30,itemwidth=70]
**CRUD Bills**:: I can add/edit/delete bills with payee, amount, due date, frequency.
**Upcoming Reminders**:: I can see bills due in the next X days on my dashboard.
**Notifications**:: The system flags upcoming due dates daily.
****

.Backend Tasks
****
. Create `Bill` model/table (payee, amount, due\_date, frequency).
. Add CRUD endpoints under `/api/bills` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
. Build `tasks/reminders.py`:
   * Daily job that scans for bills due in the next 7 days.
   * Store or return a list of upcoming reminders.
. Expose `GET /api/bills/upcoming?days=7`.
. Write tests for bill CRUD and reminder logic.
****

.Frontend Tasks
****
1. Scaffold `/bills` page in Next.js: list existing bills, “Add Bill” form.
2. Use SWR to fetch `/api/bills` and `/api/bills/upcoming`.
3. Display upcoming reminders on the dashboard or a bell icon.
4. Implement forms to create/edit bills; call POST/PUT/DELETE.
5. Add UI tests for bill CRUD and reminders.
****

== Acceptance Criteria
* Bills can be added/edited/deleted via UI and persist to DB.
* Dashboard shows upcoming bills (e.g. “Rent due in 3 days”).
* Daily reminder logic correctly identifies upcoming due dates.

== Conclusion
**Once Sprint 4 is done**, you&apos;ll have a full MVP: historical onboarding, transaction persistence, categorization, envelope budgeting, and basic bill reminders—ready for user testing and feedback!
